An approach where we will compare two numbers using if-else
statement and will print the output accordingly.

# python program to find
# maximum of two numbers

    def maximum(a, b):
        if a >= b:
            return a
        else:
            return b

    # Driver code
    a = 2
    b = 4
    print(maximum(a,b))
    Output
    4

    Using max().function
     This function is used to find the maximum of the values passed as      its arguments.

     # Python program to find the 
     #maximum of two numbers

     a = 2
     b = 4

     maximum = max(a, b)
     print(maximum)
     Output
     4

     Conditional expression
      # Python program to find the
      # maximum of two numbers
        
        # Driver code
        a = 2
        b = 4

        # Use of ternary operator
        print(a if a >= b else b)
             Output
